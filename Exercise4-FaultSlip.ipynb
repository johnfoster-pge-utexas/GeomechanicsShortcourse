    "A major fault in your reservoir has strike N35$^\\circ$W and dip 60$^\\circ$ from horizontal. $S_{hmin}$ in this area acts along 020$^\\circ$, and in situ stresses are $S_{hmin}=70$ MPa, $S_{Hmax}=80$ MPa, $S_v=65$ MPa.   Assume the pore pressure $P_p =30$ MPa. Is the fault likely to slip if the respective frictional coefficient is $\\mu=0.7$?"

    "Assuming the same reservior conditions as Problem 1, write a computer code that can compute the resolved shear stress magnitude and normal effective stress on a fault characterized by the strike direction and dip angle.  Now randomly generate 10000 faults (use a statistical distribution to choose random pairs of strike and dip) and plot the results on a Mohr diagram (i.e. shear stress as a function of normal stress).  Where do near vertical strike-slip faults appear on this diagram? Where do the oblique-slip faults fall?"
