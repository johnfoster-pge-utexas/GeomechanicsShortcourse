# Why is stress important in petroleum engineering?

---

## Wellbore failure occurs because the stress around the well exceeds the strength of the rock.

## Faults will slip when the ratio of shear to normal stress on the fault exceeds its frictional strength.

## Reservior depletion causes changes in the stress state at depth that can be beneficial, or detrimental, to production.
