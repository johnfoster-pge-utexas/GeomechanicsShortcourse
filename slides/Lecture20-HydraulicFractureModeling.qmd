## Analytical Models

Analytical hydraulic fracture models use

- Fracture geometry assumptions
- Conservation of mass in fracture
- Elasticty theory for fracture opening
- Crack tip energetics

## PKN Assumptions {.smaller}

- The formation toughness $K_{Ic}$ can be neglected because the energy required to propagate in the fracture is significantly less than that required to allow fluid flow along the fracture
- The fluid is injected with a constant injection volumetric rate $Q_0$ from a fixed line source at the center of the fracture into two wings
- The injected fluid is incompressible Newtonian laminar unidirectional flow characterized with viscosity $\mu$ and the gravity effect is excluded
- Constant flow rate $q$ along the fracture (No storage effect or fluid leakoff)
- The net pressure is zero at the tip

## PKN Equations

\begin{align}
L &= \frac{Q_0}{2 \pi C_L H} t^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
w_o &= \left(\frac{Q_0^2 \mu}{\pi^3 E^{\prime} C_L H}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}} t^{\frac{1}{8}} \\
p_o &= 2 \left( \frac{E^{\prime 3} Q_o^2 \mu}{\pi^3 C_L H^6}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}} t^{\frac{1}{8}}
\end{align}

## KGD Assumptions {.smaller}

- The formation is an infinite, homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic medium characterized by Young’s modulus $E$, Poisson’s ratio $\nu$, and toughness $K_{Ic}$.
- The fracture is assumed to be radially symmetric and generated from a point-source at its center. The periphery of the fracture is circular (penny-shaped), as shown in @fig-kgd.
- The fracturing fluid is Newtonian with viscosity $\mu$ . It is injected with a constant volumetric flow rate $Q_o$, and its flow is laminar. Gravitational effects are not taken into account.
- The Barenblatt's tip condition applies for the fracture. 

## KGD Equations (no leakoff)


\begin{align}
R &= \left( \frac{3 E^{\prime} Q_0 t}{8 \sqrt{\pi} K_{Ic}}\right)^{0.4} \\
p_0 &= \frac{\sqrt{\pi} K_{Ic}}{2 \sqrt{R}} \\
w_0 &= \frac{8 p_0 R}{\pi E^{\prime}}
\end{align}
