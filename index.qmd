**Course Description** This is a short course on petroleum reservoir geomechanics.  The primary emphasis in this course is basic stress and strain analysis; pore pressure and in situ stress estimation and measurement; deformation mechanisms in rock; rock fracture description and analysis; wellbore stresses and failure; wellbore stability analysis; fault stability analysis; depletion-induced reservoir deformation; and hydraulic fracturing.

**Exercises Coding Environment**

There will some optional coding exercises in Python in this course.  If you'd like to follow along and run live code, you'll need to have a [Github](https://github.com) account.  If you don't have one already, you can register for free [here](https://github.com/signup).  Once you have an account, you should be able to click the link below to access a live coding environment for the exercises:
